"The Sub-Zero Intelligence Framework for Behavioral Telemetry and Covert Threat Detection"

Zero//Stack is a premium SDK that is license-based, modular, high-entropy fingerprinting and behavioral telemetry framework built for security-critical environments like Web3, fintech, and decentralized identity platforms. It collects deep client-side intelligence across hardware, browser, behavioral, and environmental layers, transforming it into a structured trace profile in real time. Each plugin is purpose-built — from GPU and font rendering fingerprints to session velocity, wallet injection detection, clipboard entropy, DOM anomaly detection, and advanced WebRTC/audio leakage — giving platforms unprecedented visibility into user authenticity, spoofing attempts, and threat patterns.

What sets Zero//Stack apart is its fully extensible plugin architecture, STIX 2.1-compatible data mapping, and its ability to operate in both browser and Node.js environments using .env-driven configurations. Every trace can be dynamically mapped, structured semantically, and exported or streamed via API, WebSocket, or webhook — ready to power threat intelligence feeds, user trust scores, or decentralized reputation systems. It’s not just a fingerprinting tool — it’s a real-time observability layer for Web3 safety and behavioral telemetry at the edge.
