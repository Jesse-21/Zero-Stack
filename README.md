"The Sub-Zero Intelligence Framework for Behavioral Telemetry and Covert Threat Detection"

Zero//Stack is a premium SDK that is license-based, modular, high-entropy fingerprinting and behavioral telemetry framework built for security-critical environments like Web3, fintech, and decentralized identity platforms. It collects deep client-side intelligence across hardware, browser, behavioral, and environmental layers, transforming it into a structured trace profile in real time. Each plugin is purpose-built — from GPU and font rendering fingerprints to session velocity, wallet injection detection, clipboard entropy, DOM anomaly detection, and advanced WebRTC/audio leakage — giving platforms unprecedented visibility into user authenticity, spoofing attempts, and threat patterns.

What sets Zero//Stack apart is its fully extensible plugin architecture, STIX 2.1-compatible data mapping, and its ability to operate in both browser and Node.js environments using .env-driven configurations. Every trace can be dynamically mapped, structured semantically, and exported or streamed via API, WebSocket, or webhook — ready to power threat intelligence feeds, user trust scores, or decentralized reputation systems. It’s not just a fingerprinting tool — it’s a real-time observability layer for Web3 safety and behavioral telemetry at the edge.


The Zero Tap Labs API & SDK infrastructure is the foundational access layer to an elite-grade threat observability and telemetry system built for the future of Web3 security. It delivers modular, high-performance capabilities to developers, analysts, fraud responders, and enterprise security teams — without exposing the inner core of the intelligence fabric.

This system enables secure interaction with real-time behavioral telemetry, fraud signal mapping, and risk profiling via lightweight SDK modules and hardened API pathways. It is designed to be effortlessly integrated into applications, wallets, sites, or infrastructure that require live security insight without compromising speed, privacy, or integrity.



Mission

Empower developers and Web3 builders with trusted, invisible security tools that function with surgical precision, speed, and silence.

By offering plug-and-play access to Zero Tap Labs' core threat intelligence engine, our platform allows Web3 projects to defend users before they become targets — and do so without needing to expose internal systems, user identities, or trade secrets.



Why It Matters

In a permissionless digital ecosystem, attack vectors evolve faster than any single entity can track. Zero Tap Labs solves this by:
Offering real-time signal analysis via SDK plugins

Providing automated threat detection & response based on on-chain/off-chain data fusion
Powering traceable intelligence workflows with accountability and observability in mind
Supporting modular deployment, so components can be injected surgically into live apps or edge environments

This isn’t threat intelligence as a service — this is threat advantage as a framework.



What Sets It Apart

Zero Friction: One-line SDK drops, no major re-architecture required
Anonymity Preserving: No need for wallet linking or KYC to receive threat intelligence benefits
Dynamic Scoring: Built-in risk scoring engine that evolves based on user behavior and environmental conditions
TEL-Integrated: First in Web3 to utilize the "Transactional Exhaust Layer" — previously overlooked metadata from EVM transaction residue — to predict early-stage threat signatures
Cross-Environment: Use the same logic stack across Python, Node, or browser contexts
Built for Builders: Developer-first documentation, tiered API key access, and scalable pricing



Use Cases

Wallets and dApps seeking on-device risk awareness
Platforms requiring behavioral fingerprinting and fraud profiling
Auditors or investigators needing traceable SDK event logs
Projects offering trust & safety APIs to third-party clients



Closing Note

Zero Tap Labs exists to bridge the gap between real-time insight and real-world protection — without bloat, buzzwords, or brittle dependencies. As the threats evolve, so will this stack — quietly, constantly, and always in your corner.
